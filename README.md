📘 Comprehensive Description
This experiment explores how interactive agent-based simulations can model cooperation, competition, and adaptation in dynamic environments. Each agent operates under energy constraints and adjusts its behavior according to environmental stimuli, revealing emergent intelligence at the system level. The goal is to show how collective behaviors can evolve naturally from decentralized interactions, forming adaptive stability without central control.

🧠 Objective
To create a simulation framework that enables the observation and measurement of:
• Adaptive and emergent behavior in multi-agent systems
• The impact of local decisions on global equilibrium
• Self organizing mechanisms that arise from independent agent interactions

✏️ Results
The simulation demonstrated that high-energy agents tend to adopt cooperative strategies, enhancing system stability and collective efficiency. Meanwhile, low-energy agents exhibited competitive behaviors to secure resources. Over time, a dynamic equilibrium emerged, balancing cooperation and competition while maintaining environmental sustainability. This outcome illustrates the core principle of decentralized intelligence — stability achieved through collective adaptation.

📗 Observations
• The system exhibits self-organizing dynamics without external supervision
• Cooperation strengthens the collective outcome
• Competition maintains balance within the ecosystem
• The overall simulation demonstrates how adaptive intelligence emerges through interaction rather than control
